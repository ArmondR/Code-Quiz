## Description

This project is a quiz challenge game. The objective for this project is to engage the user with a series of code related questions. The user must answer as many questions as they can in the given time frame. Upon completion the user has the option to save their score for later records.

## Developer intentions

The intention behind this project as the developer was to become aquainted with web APIs. To demonstrate understanding of combining HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create dynamic and interactive elements. Further enhance my understanding of using the DOM and incorporating localStorage.
